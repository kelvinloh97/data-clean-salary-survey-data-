# data-clean-salary-survey-data project
This is a data cleaning and preprocessing exercise conducted on a real world survey data on salary dataset sourced from https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/04/a-real-world-messy-dataset-to-practice-on/. The data is a Salary Survey from AskAManager.org. 

The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with messy real world datasets.It is also to train my data cleaning and preprocessing skills. EDA is also performed on the dataset.

The dataset is a good practice as it has a mixture of categorical and numerical features, with multiple inconsistencies/duplicates, outliers and nan values.

I would move on with this project by presenting an easy to use dashboard that can help others to find out their salary expectation in their fields based on their personal experiences and individual characteristics.
